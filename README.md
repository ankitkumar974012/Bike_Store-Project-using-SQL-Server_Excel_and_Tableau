# Bike_Store-Project-using-SQL-Server_Excel_and_Tableau

This is a portfolio project using SQL, Excel, and Tableau, all three of which are interlinked and based on the same dataset acquired from the SQL Server Tutorial. More precisely, I have built a comprehensive sales dashboard for the executive team at the theoretical bicycle retail company. The dataset is first inserted into SQL Server (as Company database) using an SQL script (which includes creating a database, two schemas, and tables) and then pulling out the relevant data from the company's database into a table form using an SQL script to design a well-structured and dynamic dashboard using Excel and Tableau. 

In a brief overview, the first thing is to tap into the company's relational database by writing an SQL script to generate a detailed dataset that provides all the data and information to put together a comprehensive and dynamic sales dashboard for the executive team. Next, to import the SQL-generated dataset by directly connecting the Excel with SQL server as direct connection and then use pivot tables to develop a dynamic dashboard, and finally to import the Excel datasheet that contains the SQL-generated dataset to Tableau and use the information of that data to create a dynamic dashboard for the management.
